SnakeAI

I trained a neural network using a genetic algorithm to create an agent that understood the basic mechanics of the game. I implemented the neural network and genetic algorithm myself to better understand how those work and function together. Our final agent, the one put into 'runSingle.py', was able to consistently go in the direction of food, and generally avoid walls and itself. It had a small quirk that it would go to the left wall in between eating every food. Through this I learned how neural networks work and are trained, and how this can be applied to many different situations.

Connect Four Bot
----------------
Using a min-max search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and other techniques, I've made a bot to play against on a simple ascii playing board. The depth of search can be altered for a stronger bot. I recommend running the jupyter notebook in google colab, as that's the environment I developed it in.
